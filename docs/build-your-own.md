Printing one of the designs is fairly simple. There is only 1 part! But... it is multicolor so an automatic material system (AMS) is required.

### Tools and Materials
The following tools and materials have been tested for printing the current designs.
Naturally, you can use other tools and materials but your process may need some adapting.
